# Predator-Prey-Interactions-Analysis
Group Project completed for Ordinary Differential Equation class.

This paper is about analyzing the impact of climate change in predator-prey models by using existing data.

Researching by using past data and papers to analysis predator-prey models. Building upon existing equations to create our own models to predict future outcomes in different scenarios. Analysis and graphs were conducted in Python using Jupyter notebook.
